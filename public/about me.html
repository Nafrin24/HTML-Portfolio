<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
 Hi, I’m NAFRIN, and I’m a beginner web developer with a focus on **HTML**. I’ve recently started my journey into web development and have become fascinated by how HTML forms the backbone of every webpage. I enjoy learning how to structure content, create accessible web layouts, and make websites that are both functional and visually appealing. While I’m still expanding my skills, I’m excited to continue building my knowledge of web development and to explore other technologies like CSS and JavaScript in the future. My goal is to create websites that are easy to navigate and provide users with an enjoyable experience. I’m looking forward to growing as a developer and taking on new challenges!
